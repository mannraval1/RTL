A comprehensive repository of high-performance, synthesizable **Register Transfer Level (RTL)** designs. This project serves as a practical guide and library for digital logic implementation, targeting both FPGA and ASIC workflows.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository focuses on the bridge between high-level logic and physical hardware. It contains a curated selection of modules ranging from fundamental gates to complex state machines, all optimized for timing, area, and power.

### Key Highlights
* **Synthesizable Code:** Fully compatible with industry-standard tools like Vivado, Quartus, and Design Compiler.
* **Modular Design:** Optimized for reusability across different digital systems.
* **Best Practices:** Implements standard coding guidelines for clocking, resets, and signal synchronization.
